Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)

This principle states that “Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes”.
In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without
interrupting the behavior of the program.
This principle is bit tricky and interesting all it designed based on Inheritance concepts
